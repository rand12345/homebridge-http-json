# homebridge-http-json

Simple HTTP JSON client for [Homebridge HomeKit](https://github.com/nferro/homebridge-http-json/).

You can refer to `config-section.json` to see how to set it up on you Homebridge `config.json`.

Forked and envolved from [homebridge-http-thermostat](https://github.com/nferro/homebridge-http-json/)

Fork: Plan is to modify this to display as many parameters from a hybrid solar system, pushing the data via a http request.
